Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) experiments allow us to discover new cell types and help us understand how they arise in development. The Monocle 3 package provides a toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression experiments.

Monocle 3 can help you perform three main types of analysis:

Clustering, classifying, and counting cells. Single-cell RNA-Seq experiments allow you to discover new (and possibly rare) subtypes of cells. Monocle 3 helps you identify them.
Constructing single-cell trajectories. In development, disease, and throughout life, cells transition from one state to another. Monocle 3 helps you discover these transitions.
Differential expression analysis. Characterizing new cell types and states begins with comparisons to other, better understood cells. Monocle 3 includes a sophisticated, but easy-to-use system for differential expression.
